# Pong
A small Pong game and one of the first programs I wrote for a school assignment.

The game can be played using the arrow keys but the [master_controller](https://github.com/welteki/Pong/tree/master_controller) branch contains the code and arduino sketch that was originally used to play the game with a rudimentary gamepad over a serial connection.


The gamepad was constructed using an arduino Uno and contained a potentiometer to control the paddle. It also contained an led and buzzer that turned on every time the ball hit the paddle. Unfortunately I do not have any pictures or sketches of the breadboard layout for the gamepad.
